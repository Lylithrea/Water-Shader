# Description

This project is used to measure the most common functionality a water shader has. This project contains a water shader with lots of public 
variables, multiple meshes, and a few scripts to help test.
Tests are done by changing the variables of the shader and measuring the FPS.

## Create new test

1. Select CSV Writer in the hierachy.
2. Change the following parameters to your liking:
 - File name
 - Wait timer
 - Values which you want to test
 
To get the results, either press play within unity editor or play the build, once running press space.
Once done it should output an excel file to the assets folder. 
If you start the test with the same name it will overwrite the previous file, thus deleting everything from the previous test.
